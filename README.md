# Cargo Loading Optimizer
A web application that utilizes the Binary Knapsack Problem and Dynamic Programming Algorithm in solving the optimal set of boxes that should be loaded in a cargo vehicle with limited capacity. This was our senior thesis, accomplised last November 2022. 

CONTRIBUTIONS:

●	Led a four-member team in accomplishing a research paper and a web application which used the Binary Knapsack Problem and Dynamic Programming Algorithm in solving the optimal set of boxes that should be loaded in a cargo vehicle with limited capacity.

●	Enhanced the web app’s backend Python algorithm by 100% through conditional statements that ensured solution accuracy.

●	Delegated tasks to members, assessed tasks, and facilitated the completion of the project by organizing weekly meetings.
